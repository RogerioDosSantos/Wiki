# AI Markdown Documentation Generation Instructions

Follow these instructions to generate clear, professional Markdown documentation:

## 1. Structure Content with Heading Hierarchy
- Use Markdown headings (# to ######) to organize content logically.
- Begin with a Level 1 heading for the main topic or product overview.
- Use Level 2 and Level 3 headings for sections and subsections.

## 2. Emphasize Key Information
- Use **bold** for important terms or concepts.
- Use *italic* for supplementary notes or clarifications.
- Use ~~strikethrough~~ for deprecated or obsolete features.

## 3. Present Data with Tables
- Use Markdown tables to display comparisons, feature lists, or structured data.
- Align columns for readability.

## 4. Display Code and Commands
- Use fenced code blocks (triple backticks) for code, specifying the language for syntax highlighting.
- Preserve formatting and indentation.
- Add a brief description before code blocks to explain their purpose.
- For independent command list, split each command into its own line with a brief description. The description should go before the command, not after.

## 5. Highlight Notes with Blockquotes
- Use > to create blockquotes for tips, warnings, or important notes.
- Include relevant icons or bolded labels for emphasis (e.g., 📌 **Tip**).

## 6. Organize with Lists
- Use ordered lists for sequences or steps.
- Use unordered lists for feature points or options.
- Nest lists as needed for hierarchy.

## 7. Improve Readability with Spacing and Rules
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate major sections.
- Add line breaks and paragraphs to prevent dense text.

## 8. Enhance Navigation with Links and Anchors
- Add internal links and anchors for easy navigation in long documents.
- Do not provide a table of contents. The host of the documentation will generate it automatically.

## 9. Insert and Describe Images
- Use Markdown image syntax to embed images.
- Add descriptive captions or headings for context.
- Adjust image size or layout as needed for clarity.

## 10. Show Progress with Task Lists
- Use task lists (- [ ] and - [x]) to indicate project or feature status.

## 11. (Optional) Use Advanced Components for Professional Documentation
- For API or technical docs, use container, columns, and step components if supported.
- Embed reusable data schemas where appropriate.
