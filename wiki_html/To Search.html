They will push Microsoft store.

<li>
Azure IoT Edge (Enables cloud technology to run on the device) 

<li>
It can export the Cloud application and they export to a docker container that can be used on the IoT device.

<li>
Azure cloud shell and Azure mobile app.

<li>
Snap point on Visual Studio to get dumps when pass to it. Similar to breakpoint but does not stop the application

<li>
Visual Studio is available for Mac.

<li>
They are proivifing MySQL as service

<li>
Look on Azure Cosmos DB

<li>
Look on Gremilin

Look at .Net IoT framework

<li>
*Visual Studio support cross container debugging

<li>
Continuous delivery on Visual Studio 2017. They are pushing to Azure.

<li>
Visual Studio support build pipeline

<li>
You can add the docker container compose direct to Azure.

<li>
Look in Microsoft Service Fabric

<ul>
<li>
Desktop bridge - Tool that allow repack the code to use UWP.

<li>
They admits the mistake done before whem migrating new applications.

<li>
You run the intaller once and it encapsulates into a container. 

<li>
Note: More information the the resitry means hier hives and slower OS. The reason is because the registry loads it when the OS boots.

<li>
The aim is to not change the code. This does not garantee that a change in the code will not be needed, however. E.g.: Code that requires system elavation. The apps that requires changes have a very small change amount.

<li>
COM objects are supported.

<li>
Once the API was converted we can distribute on the Windows Store and also target the Windows S version

<li>
COM objects should be only out of proc. That was intentionally left out due security (It is the major case of GPFs). In proc is there.

<li>
Look in WACK

<li>
The new full office is on the Windows Store. It used the "Desktop bridge" to do it

</ul>

<div id="To Search-Notes from Microsoft Build-Bring your desktop app to UWP (Universal Windows Platform) and Windows Store-The Path to do it"><h4 id="The Path to do it">The Path to do it</h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
Convert the Windows App Package.

<li>
For windows 8 and forward you no longer needs your old installer.

<li>
<span id="To Search-Notes from Microsoft Build-Bring your desktop app to UWP (Universal Windows Platform) and Windows Store-The Path to do it-InstallShield has a plugin that does it automatically. You might not need to do it manually and once it works you can integrated on the daily build."></span><strong id="InstallShield has a plugin that does it automatically.

<li>
Visual Studio 2017 can also generates that Package.

<li>
Mordernize with Windows 10 features.

<li>
There are some items that is only available on the UWP. E.g.: Files

<li>
There is a way that you can commincation a new application UWP and talkback with the bridge application using commincation channel.

<li>
Look into on the Background task model.

<li>
Limitation is that we cannot create process on UWP (Small limitation). You native can do basically everything!

<li>
<span id="To Search-Notes from Microsoft Build-Bring your desktop app to UWP (Universal Windows Platform) and Windows Store-The Path to do it-Huge: On the end it puts the libraries into a folder.

<li>
They beleive the migration for Windows 10 will happens because of security!

<div id="To Search-Notes from Microsoft Build-Bring your desktop app to UWP (Universal Windows Platform) and Windows Store-Questions"><h4 id="Questions">Questions</h4></div>

<ul>
<li>
How it works with device drivers? How about regular I/Os e.g.: serial ports, USB, etc...?
  <code>It talks with a kernel driver without a problem</code>

<li>
How signature of files works?
  <code>You can sign your files before</code>

<li>
If I call the new API how it would work on the previous version of windows (E.g.: Windows 7)?

</ul>
  
<ul>
<li>
When you define parts of your application target to the device, how will be the footprint when installed? Are they going only to download the component related to that devices?

</ul>
