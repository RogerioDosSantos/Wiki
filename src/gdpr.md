# GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation

## When a personal data can be processed 

In order for personal data to be processed, at least one of the following conditions must be met:

- The data subject has given consent.
- Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract that includes the data subject.
- Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation.
- Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person.
- Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
- Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party.

If the data do not meet one of these conditions, then those data cannot be collected, stored or transmitted in any way.

## Personal Data Breach and Notification

A personal data breach is defined in the GDPR as 'a breach of security that leads to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed'.

In the event of a personal data breach, controllers must report the breach to the supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach in clear and plain language.

The only exception to this is if the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the data subject’s rights and freedoms.

## Individuals Rights

The GDPR grants every data subject new rights and strengthens their existing rights.

- Right of access – An individual has the right to know whether his or her personal data are being processed by a controller, the purposes for processing, the categories of personal data being processed, and the recipients of said data.
- Right to transparency – Controllers are required to provide information and communication of data processing to individuals, 'using clear and plain language'.
- Right to erasure – Also known as the 'right to be forgotten', data controllers must, in a timely manner, erase personal data per the subject’s request and inform other controllers that are also processing the data of said request.
- Right to data portability – Article 20 states that the data subject shall have the right to receive the personal data concerning him or her in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance'.
- Right to object – Data subjects can object to the processing of their data at any time, after which data controllers must demonstrate compelling, legitimate reasons to continue processing.

## Data Protection

GDPR requires that controllers and processors protect data by design and default.

Organisations must create policies to protect data from the beginning of when those data were processed.

They also must take the appropriate technical measures to ensure the protection of data throughout their lifecycle.

Organisations must ensure that, when collecting and storing data for one specific purpose, they should not use or transmit it for any other purpose.

The goal of 'privacy by design and default' is to make data protection a fundamental process of organisations worldwide and not just a matter of legislation.
