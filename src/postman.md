# Postman 

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) is an *API client* that helps a lot on the test and development of *APIs*. It allows you to:

- Quickly and easily send REST, SOAP, and GraphQL requests directly within Postman
- Automate manual tests and integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that any code changes won't break the API in production. 
- Communicate the expected behavior of an API by simulating endpoints and their responses without having to set up a backend server. 
- Generate and publish beautiful, machine-readable documentation to make your API easier to consume. 
- Stay up-to-date on the health of your API by checking performance and response times at scheduled intervals.
- Provide a shared context for building and consuming APIs, and collaborate in real-time with built-in version control.
