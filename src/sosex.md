# SOSex 

[SOSex](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/jankrivanek/setting-up-managed-code-debugging-with-sos-and-sosex) is one of the few existing Windows Debugger extensions for managed code (.NET). It adds a few useful commands to the basic SOS, but its command reference is not easy to find online.
