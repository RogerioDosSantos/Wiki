# AI Models

AI models are mathematical and computational constructs designed to perform tasks that require intelligence, such as prediction, classification, generation, and decision-making. They are the foundation of modern artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, powering applications from image recognition to natural language processing.

- **Generalization**: Ability to make predictions or decisions on unseen data.
- **Adaptability**: Can be fine-tuned or retrained for new tasks or domains.
- **Automation**: Enable automation of complex tasks, reducing manual effort.
- **Scalability**: Can process vast amounts of data efficiently.
- **Versatility**: Support a wide range of applications, including vision, speech, text, and recommendation systems.

## Common Types of AI Models

| Model Type         | Description                                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression  | Predicts a continuous value based on input features.              |
| Decision Tree      | Splits data into branches for classification or regression.       |
| Random Forest      | Ensemble of decision trees for improved accuracy.                 |
| Support Vector Machine | Finds the optimal boundary for classification tasks.          |
| Neural Network     | Composed of layers of interconnected nodes for deep learning.     |
| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | Specialized for image and spatial data.           |
| Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)     | Handles sequential data, such as time series.     |
| Transformer        | State-of-the-art for language and sequence modeling.              |
| Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) | Generates new data similar to training data.    |
