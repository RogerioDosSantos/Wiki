# Alpine Linux

[Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based on musl libc and BusyBox. It is designed for power users who appreciate simplicity, resource efficiency, and security. Alpine is widely used in container environments (such as Docker) due to its minimal footprint and fast boot times.
