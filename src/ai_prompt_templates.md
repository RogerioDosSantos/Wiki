# AI Prompt Templates

*AI Prompt Templates* are structured text patterns or frameworks designed to guide artificial intelligence models, such as large language models (LLMs), in generating desired outputs. 
They help users communicate their intent clearly to the AI, improving the relevance, accuracy, and consistency of responses.

## Features
- Standardize and streamline AI interactions
- Enable reproducible and consistent outputs
- Support parameterization for dynamic content
- Facilitate prompt engineering and experimentation
- Can be shared and versioned for team use
