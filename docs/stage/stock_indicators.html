<h2 id="macd-moving-average-convergence-divergence">MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)</h2>
<p>Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the &quot;signal line&quot;, is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell signals.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Crossovers - As shown in the chart above, when the MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal, which indicates that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when the MACD rises above the signal line, the indicator gives a bullish signal, which suggests that the price of the asset is likely to experience upward momentum. Many traders wait for a confirmed cross above the signal line before entering into a position to avoid getting &quot;faked out&quot; or entering into a position too early, as shown by the first arrow.</p></li>
<li><p>Divergence - When the security price diverges from the MACD, it signals the end of the current trend. For example, a stock price that is rising and a MACD indicator that is falling could mean that the rally is about to end. Conversely, if a stock price is falling and the MACD is rising, it could mean that a bullish reversal could occur in the near-term. Traders often use divergence in conjunction with other technical indicators to find opportunities.</p></li>
