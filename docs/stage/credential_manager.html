<p>Credential Manager is where Windows stores passwords and login details.</p>
<p>Credential Manager is the &quot;digital locker&quot; where Windows stores log-in credentials like usernames, passwords, and addresses. This information can be saved by Windows for use on your local computer, on other computers in the same network, servers or internet locations such as websites.This data can be used by Windows itself or by apps and programs like File Explorer, Microsoft Office, Skype, virtualization software and so on. Credentials are split into several categories:</p>
<p>Windows Credentials - are used only by Windows and its services. For example, Windows can use these credentials to automatically log you into the shared folders of another computer on your network. It can also store the password of the Homegroup you have joined and uses it automatically each time you access what is being shared in that Homegroup. If you type a wrong log-in credential, Windows remembers it and fails to access what you need. If this happens, you can edit or remove the incorrect credential, as shown in later sections of this article. Certificate-Based Credentials - they are used together with smart-cards, mostly in complex business network environments. Most people will never need to use such credentials and this section is empty on their computers. However, if you want to know more about them, read this article from Microsoft: Guidelines for enabling smart card logon with third-party certification authorities. Generic Credentials - are defined and used by some of the apps you install in Windows, so that they get the authorisation to use certain resources. Examples of such apps include OneDrive, Slack, Xbox Live, etc. Web Credentials - they represent logon information for websites that is stored by Windows, Skype, Internet Explorer or other Microsoft apps. They exist only in Windows 10 and Windows 8.1, but not in Windows 7. In Windows 10 and Windows 8.1, Certificate-Based Credentials and Generic Credentials are grouped in the Windows Credentials section.</p>
<p>These credentials are automatically stored and managed by Windows and the applications that you use. The Credential Manager receives notifications when authentication information changes and updates it automatically, saving the latest valid information. Unless you want to know which credentials are stored on your computer or you need to remove or edit an incorrect one, you do not need to use the Credential Manager.</p>
