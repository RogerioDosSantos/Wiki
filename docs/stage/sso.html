<h1 id="single-sign-on-sso">Single Sign-On (SSO)</h1>
<p><em>Single Sign-On (SSO)</em> is an alternative access method which allows users to have access to several <em>service providers (SP)</em> (for example <em>WebSites or Services</em>) without having to manually login when accessing the site via an agreed route.</p>
<h2 id="sso-with-federated-idps">SSO with Federated IdPs</h2>
<p><em>Federated Access Management</em> builds a trust relationship between <em>identity providers (IdP)</em> and <em>service providers (SP)</em>. It devolves the responsibility for <em>authentication</em> to a <em>user's home organisation</em>, and establishes <em>authorisation</em> through the secure exchange of information (known as <em>attributes</em>) between the two parties.</p>

<h3 id="access-federation">Access Federation</h3>
<p>Federation members needing access to resources install <em>identity provider (IdP)</em> software, and members providing resources install <em>service provider (SP)</em> software. Members sign up to an agreed set of policies for exchanging information about <em>users</em> and <em>resources</em>. The <em>federation operator</em> acts as a <em>registrar</em> for this information, which describes the configuration of the members' identity and <em>service providers</em>. The information is known as <em>metadata</em>.</p>
<p>How <em>authentication</em> is carried out by the <em>identity provider</em> and how <em>rights management</em> is carried out by the <em>service provider</em> is left up to the respective parties. Thus, <em>federated access management</em> depends on a <em>certain level of trust</em>. These <em>trust agreements</em> are managed by <em>federations</em>. <em>Federations</em> are typically being established at a national level.</p>
