<h2 id="kernel-namespaces">Kernel namespaces</h2>
<ul>
<li>Namespaces provide the first and most straightforward form of isolation: processes running within a container cannot see, and even less affect, processes running in another container, or in the host system</li>
<li>Each container also gets its own network stack, meaning that a container doesn’t get privileged access to the sockets or interfaces of another container.</li>
<li>From a network architecture point of view, all containers on a given Docker host are sitting on bridge interfaces</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="control-groups">Control groups</h2>
<ul>
<li>They implement resource accounting and limiting</li>
<li>Ensure that each container gets its fair share of memory, CPU, disk I/O; and, more importantly, that a single container cannot bring the system down by exhausting one of those resources</li>
<li>They are essential to fend off some denial-of-service attacks</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="docker-daemon-attack-surface">Docker daemon attack surface</h2>
<ul>
<li>Docker daemon requires root privileges. There is a mode called <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/">Rootless mode</a> (experimental).</li>
<li>Since the daemon has <em>root privileges</em>, it can for example access Ports with numbers 0–1023 which are called system or well-known ports.</li>
