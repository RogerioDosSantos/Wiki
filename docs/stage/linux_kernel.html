<p>Policy-free drivers (Preferred) have a number of typical characteristics: - These include support for both synchronous and asynchronous operation - The ability to be opened multiple times - The ability to exploit the full capabilities of the hardware - The lack of software layers to simplify things or provide policy-related operations.</p>
<p>Device Types: - Char modules: Streams (open, close, read and write) - Block modules: Allow connect per block (512 bytes or any x^2). It easily mapped to a node of the file system (open, close, read and write). - Network modules: Sockets and packet transmission.</p>
