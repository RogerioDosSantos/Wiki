# SignalR 

[ASP.NET SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/signalr/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-signalr) is a library for *ASP.NET* developers that simplifies the process of adding *real-time web functionality* to applications. *Real-time web functionality* is the ability to have *server code* push content to connected *clients* instantly as it becomes available, rather than having the *server* wait for a *client* to request new data.

*SignalR* can be used to add any sort of "real-time" web functionality to your *ASP.NET application*.
