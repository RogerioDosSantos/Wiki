## Optimum Investiment return ratio

Optimum on how much you should invest to get the best medium probability of return:

$$ f^* = \frac{pw}{lp} - \frac{pl}{wb} $$

Where:

- f*: Optimum of money you should invest to have the best return ratio
- wb: Win benefit (E.g.: When head you win 80% >> wb = 0.8)
- lp: Lose penalty (E.g.: When tail you lose 50% >> lp = 0.5)
- pw: Probability to Win (E.g.: For coin toss >> ps = 0.5)
- pl: Probability to Loose (E.g.: For coin toss >> ps = 0.5)
