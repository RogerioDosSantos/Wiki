# DocFX 

[DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html) is an API documentation generator for .NET, which currently supports C#, VB and F#. It generates API reference documentation from triple-slash comments in your source code. It also allows you to use Markdown files to create additional topics such as tutorials and how-tos, and to customize the generated reference documentation. DocFX builds a static HTML website from your source code and Markdown files, which can be easily hosted on any web server (for example, github.io).
