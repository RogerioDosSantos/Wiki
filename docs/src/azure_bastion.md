# Azure Bastion 

[Azure Bastion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) service is a new fully *platform-managed PaaS* service that you provision inside your *virtual network*. It provides secure and seamless *RDP/SSH connectivity* to your *virtual machines* directly in the *Azure portal* over TLS. When you connect via *Azure Bastion*, your virtual machines do not need a public IP address.

*Bastion* provides *secure RDP and SSH* connectivity to all of the *VMs* in the *virtual network* in which it is *provisioned*. Using *Azure Bastion* protects your *virtual machines* from exposing *RDP/SSH ports* to the outside world, while still providing secure access using *RDP/SSH*. With *Azure Bastion*, you connect to the *virtual machine* directly from the *Azure portal*. You don't need an additional client, agent, or piece of software.
