# Conan Package Manager

[Conan](https://docs.conan.io) is a decentralized package manager with a client-server architecture. This means that clients can fetch packages from, as well as upload packages to, different servers ("remotes"), similar to the "git" push-pull model to/from git remotes.

## Commands

`pip install conan`: Install *Conan* client. Note: You need to have *Python 2.7 or 3.X* distribution installed on your machine.

`conan search` : Display the current packages available in the cache.

`conan search <package_name>` : Details on the package manager

`conan search "<search_word>*" -r=conan-center` : Search for a package based in the search word passed.
