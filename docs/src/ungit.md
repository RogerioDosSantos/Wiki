# Ungit

[Ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit) brings user friendliness to git without sacrificing the versatility of git.

 * Clean and intuitive UI that makes it easy to _understand_ git.
 * Runs on any platform that node.js & git supports.
 * Web-based, meaning you can run it on your cloud/pure shell machine and use the ui from your browser (just browse to http://your-cloud-machine.com:8448).
 * Works well with GitHub.
 * [Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/) integration through plugin: https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit-gerrit
