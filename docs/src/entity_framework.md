# Entity Framework

The *Entity Framework* servers an [object-relational mapper (O/RM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping), enabling *.NET* developers to work with a *database* using *.NET* objects, and eliminating the need for most of the data-access code it usually need to write.
