== Windows Embedded Compact 2013 ==

Windows Embedded Compact 2013 supports only Compact Framework 3.9. 

Assemblies targeting previous Compact Framework versions should be recompiled even if they still run. If not recompiled, memory allocation problems can arise.

Compact Framework 3.9 is supported starting with Visual Studio 2012, so, for development, you should use VS2012 or later to be able to install the SDK.

You must install the Application Builder SDK from the device vendor to do any Compact Framework development.

== Windows CE 6.0 / 7.0==

Windows CE 7.0 supports Compact Framework 3.5 or Compact Framework 2.0 applications. 

Generally the devices are only delivered with Compact Framework 3.5.

== Windows CE 5.0 and Windows Mobile 5.0-6.x ==

Same requirements as Windows CE 7.0 with the addition that those platforms also support Compact Framework 1.0. 

To develop for Compact Framework 1.0, you should use Visual Studio 2005 Standard or Visual Studio 2003 Professional.
