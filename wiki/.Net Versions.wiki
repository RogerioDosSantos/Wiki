= .Net Versions =

== Compatibilities ==

.Net Compatibilities are defined by the version of the .Net CLR (Common Language Runtime) and not byt the version of .Net itself. Below is the list of the CLR and it respective .Net versions.

`.NET 1 CLR` : Supports .Net 1.1

`.Net 2 CLR` : Supports .Net 2, 3, 3.5

`.Net 4 CLR` : Supports .Net 4, 4.5

_E.g.: If you try to reference a library that was compiled using .Net 4.0 into an application that is set to use .Net 3.5 you will not be able to build it. The build will indicate that the reference could not be found._
