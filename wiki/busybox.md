# BusyBox

[BusyBox](https://busybox.net/) is a lightweight, single-binary utility that combines tiny versions of many common UNIX/Linux command-line tools. It is often referred to as "The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux" due to its versatility and small footprint, making it ideal for embedded systems, containers, and minimal Linux environments.

## BusyBox Docker Image

The official BusyBox Docker image is widely used for minimal containers, testing, and scripting. It provides a fast, small, and POSIX-compliant environment.

**Pull the BusyBox image:**

```sh
# Download the latest BusyBox image from Docker Hub
docker pull busybox
```

**Run a BusyBox container interactively:**
