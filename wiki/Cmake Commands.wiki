    Note:You can pass the variable type when calling the CMake executale using: 
      `-D<variable name>:STRING=<variable value>`

`file(COPY "<source directory or file>" DESTINATION "<destination directory>")`
  : Copy file or directory

`add_subdirectory(<source_dir> [<binary_dir>] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]) `
  : Add a subdirectory to the build. 

`include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] <directory1> [<directory2> ...]) `
  : Add include directories

`include(<file|module> [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE <VAR>] [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])`
